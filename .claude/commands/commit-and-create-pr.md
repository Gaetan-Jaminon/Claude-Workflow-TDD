# Commit and Create PR Command

## Purpose
Automate the final steps of the TDD workflow by creating a feature branch, committing all changes with a standardized message, pushing to remote, and creating a pull request. This combines **Steps 7 & 8** of the mandatory TDD workflow.

## When to Use
**ONLY AFTER** completing all previous TDD workflow steps:
1. ‚úÖ EXPLORE - Requirements research completed
2. ‚úÖ PLAN - Implementation plan approved 
3. ‚úÖ TEST - All failing tests written (Red phase)
4. ‚úÖ CODE - Minimal implementation completed (Green phase)
5. ‚úÖ REFACTOR - Code quality improvements completed
6. ‚úÖ All tests passing with ‚â•95% coverage

## What I Will Do

### Pre-Commit Validation
1. **Verify all tests pass** - Run full test suite
2. **Check test coverage** - Ensure ‚â•95% coverage for new code
3. **Generate business coverage report** - Create stakeholder documentation
4. **Validate no TODO/FIXME** - Ensure no temporary comments
5. **Confirm clean implementation** - No debug code or console logs

### Git Operations (Step 7)
1. **Create feature branch** using naming convention `feature/[feature-name-kebab-case]`
2. **Stage all relevant changes** for the implemented feature
3. **Generate comprehensive commit message** following project standards
4. **Commit with proper attribution** including Claude Code signature
5. **Push to remote** with upstream tracking

### PR Creation (Step 8)
1. **Generate PR title** from feature name and commit message
2. **Create comprehensive PR description** including:
   - Implementation summary
   - TDD cycles completed
   - Test coverage details
   - Technical changes overview
   - Review checklist
3. **Create pull request** targeting main branch
4. **Apply relevant labels** (feature, tdd, needs-review)
5. **Request code review** from team members

## Branch Naming Convention
- **Format**: `feature/[feature-name-kebab-case]`
- **Examples**: 
  - `feature/list-all-clients`
  - `feature/update-client`
  - `feature/delete-client`
  - `feature/client-validation`

## PR Title Format
```
feat: [Brief description of feature]
```

## PR Description Template
```markdown

## GitHub CLI Commands Used
```bash
# Create pull request
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: [Feature Name]" \
  --body "[Comprehensive PR description]" \
  --base main \
  --head feature/[feature-name] \
  --label "feature,tdd,needs-review"

# Request review (if team members specified)
gh pr edit --add-reviewer [reviewer-username]
```

## Usage Example
```
You: /commit-and-create-pr
Claude: [Runs validation checks]
Claude: ‚úÖ All tests passing (coverage: 98%)
Claude: [Creates feature branch: feature/list-all-clients]
Claude: [Stages changes and commits with standardized message]
Claude: [Pushes to remote: origin/feature/list-all-clients]
Claude: [Creates PR #X with comprehensive description]
Claude: ‚úÖ Feature successfully committed and PR created!
Claude: üîó PR URL: https://github.com/user/repo/pull/X
Claude: 
Claude: ü§ñ Claude GitHub will review this PR automatically.
Claude: Once the review is posted, use `/analyze-pr-feedback` to:
Claude: - Analyze the review feedback
Claude: - Apply approved suggestions
Claude: - Create a true pair programming experience!
```

## Failure Scenarios

### If Tests Fail
‚ùå **STOP** - Do not commit until all tests pass
- Run full test suite to identify failures
- Fix failing tests before proceeding
- Retry `/commit-and-create-pr` only after tests pass

### If Coverage Below 95%
‚ùå **STOP** - Add more tests before committing
- Identify uncovered code paths
- Write additional tests for edge cases
- Verify coverage meets standards

### If Validation Fails
‚ùå **STOP** - Clean up code before committing
- Remove TODO/FIXME comments
- Remove debug statements
- Ensure code meets quality standards

### If PR Creation Fails
‚ùå **Check GitHub CLI authentication**
- Verify `gh auth status`
- Ensure proper repository permissions
- Check branch naming and remote existence

## Claude GitHub Review Integration ü§ñ

### Next Step After PR Creation
After successfully creating the PR, Claude GitHub will automatically review your code. This creates a **pair programming dynamic** between Claude Code and Claude GitHub.

**What happens next:**
1. **Claude GitHub reviews the PR** - Usually within a few minutes
2. **Review feedback posted** - Comments on code quality, best practices, potential issues
3. **Use `/analyze-pr-feedback`** - Fetch and analyze the review feedback
4. **Collaborative improvement** - Apply approved suggestions before merge

### Review Workflow
```
Create PR ‚Üí Wait for Claude GitHub review ‚Üí /analyze-pr-feedback ‚Üí Apply changes ‚Üí Update PR
```

This collaborative review process ensures:
- üéØ Higher code quality through dual AI review
- üìö Learning from review feedback
- üõ°Ô∏è Catching issues before merge
- üë• True pair programming experience

## Success Indicators
‚úÖ All tests passing with ‚â•95% coverage
‚úÖ Feature branch created successfully
‚úÖ Comprehensive commit message generated
‚úÖ Changes pushed to remote
‚úÖ Pull request created with detailed description
‚úÖ Review requested from appropriate team members
‚úÖ Ready for Claude GitHub review
‚úÖ **Next step:** Wait for review and run `/analyze-pr-feedback`

This command ensures complete end-to-end automation from feature completion to code review, maintaining consistency and quality standards across all implementations. The integration with Claude GitHub review creates a powerful collaborative development environment.
